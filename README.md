# TensorFlow Lite Micro MTCNN implementation for ESP32-S3
This is an implementation of MTCNN (Multitask Cascading Convolutional Networks) for the ESP32-S3 SoC (System on Chip) using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. The main goal is to detect faces in low-cost hardware and reduced technical features.

## MTCNN
MTCNN is a framework developed as a solution for both face detection and face alignment. It consist in three stages of convolutional networks that are able to recognize faces and landmark location such as eyes, nose and mouth. 

### P-Net (Proposal Network)
This is a FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) that is used to obtain candidate windows and their bounding box regression vectors. Bounding box regression is a popular technique to predict the localization of boxes when the goal is detecting an object of some pre-defined class. The candidate windows obtained are calibrated with bounding box regression vectors and processed with NMS (Non Max Supression) operator to combine overlapping regions.

### R-Net (Refine Network)
The R-Net further reduces the number of candidates, performs calibration with bounding box regression and employs NMS to merge overlapping candidates. This network  is a CNN, not a FCN like P-Net sice there is a dense layer at the last stage of its architecture.

### O-Net (Output Network)
This stage is similar to the R-Net, but this Output Network aims to describe the face in more detail and output the five facial landmarksâ€™ positions for eyes, nose and mouth.

## TensorFlow implementation
To implement the MTCNN models the tools used were TensorFlow and Google Colab. TensorFlow is an open source library for ML (Machine Learning) developed for Google and it is capable to bulilding and training neural networks to detect patterns and correlations. Google Colab is a product from Google Research and allows write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is specially well suited to ML, data analysis and education.

For a correct implementation of MTCNN, the input and output data of the models must be processed to guarantee the best results. The next diagram shows the diagram block of the pipeline implemented.

The first step is to perform an image pyramid to create different scales of the input image and detect faces of different sizes. These new scaled images are the inputs to P-Net which generates the offsets and scores for each candidate window. Then these outputs are post-processed to obtain the coordinates where the faces would meet. The R-Net input must be pre-processed with the previous outputs, in this way new candidate windows are obtained. The R-Net outputs are the offsets and scores of the candidate windows that are post-processed to obtain the new coordinates where the faces would meet. Finally, for O-Net, the R-Net process is repeated and the coordinates of the faces in the input image are obtained.

The pre-process consist of two steps, crop the input image according to the bounding boxes coordinates obtained before and resize the cropped images to match the input shape of the model.

In the other hand, the post-process consist of three steps, apply NMS to combine overlapped regions, calibrate the bounding boxes with the offset obtained before, square and correct the final bounding boxes coordinates.

All the prrocesses detailed before were implemented in python in the next Google Colab Notebook.
