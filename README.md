# Face detection with MTCNN, TensorFlow Lite Micro and ESP32-S3
This is an implementation of MTCNN (Multitask Cascading Convolutional Networks) for the ESP32-S3 SoC (System on Chip) using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. The main goal is to detect faces in low-cost hardware and reduced technical features.

## MTCNN
MTCNN is a framework developed as a solution for both face detection and face alignment. It consist in three stages of convolutional networks that are able to recognize faces and landmark location such as eyes, nose and mouth. 

### P-Net (Proposal Network)
This is a FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) that is used to obtain candidate windows and their bounding box regression vectors. Bounding box regression is a popular technique to predict the localization of boxes when the goal is detecting an object of some pre-defined class. The candidate windows obtained are calibrated with bounding box regression vectors and processed with NMS (Non Max Supression) operator to combine overlapping regions.

### R-Net (Refine Network)
The R-Net further reduces the number of candidates, performs calibration with bounding box regression and employs NMS to merge overlapping candidates. This network  is a CNN, not a FCN like P-Net sice there is a dense layer at the last stage of its architecture.

### O-Net (Output Network)
This stage is similar to the R-Net, but this Output Network aims to describe the face in more detail and output the five facial landmarksâ€™ positions for eyes, nose and mouth.

## TensorFlow implementation
To implement the MTCNN models the tools used were TensorFlow and Google Colab. TensorFlow is an open source library for ML (Machine Learning) developed for Google and it is capable to bulilding and training neural networks to detect patterns and correlations. Google Colab is a product from Google Research and allows write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is specially well suited to ML, data analysis and education.

For a correct implementation of MTCNN, the input and output data of the models must be processed to guarantee the best results. The next diagram shows the diagram block of the pipeline implemented.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/mtcnn_pipeline.png" alt="MTCNN pipeline" width="50%"/>
</p>

The first step is to perform an image pyramid to create different scales of the input image and detect faces of different sizes. These new scaled images are the inputs to P-Net which generates the offsets and scores for each candidate window. Then these outputs are post-processed to obtain the coordinates where the faces would meet. The R-Net input must be pre-processed with the previous outputs, in this way new candidate windows are obtained. The R-Net outputs are the offsets and scores of the candidate windows that are post-processed to obtain the new coordinates where the faces would meet. Finally, for O-Net, the R-Net process is repeated and the coordinates of the faces in the input image are obtained.

The pre-process consist of two steps, crop the input image according to the bounding boxes coordinates obtained before and resize the cropped images to match the input shape of the model.

</p>

In the other hand, the post-process consist of three steps, apply NMS to combine overlapped regions, calibrate the bounding boxes with the offset obtained before, square and correct the final bounding boxes coordinates.

All the prrocesses detailed before and the models for TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Lite Micro were developed in the next Google Colab notebook.

## Deploying to ESP32-S3
The last step of model development show the creation of the .c files for all MTCNN models and the .h file for the models settings, which are located in ``main/models/``. The preprocess and postprocess functions that are required for the MTCNN pipeline were implemented in using C/C++ in the files ``utils.cc`` and ``utils.h``, which are located in ``main/``.

The hardware consist in the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8 and a OV2640 camera module. The use of PSRAM is mandatory, instead of ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8 another ESP32-S3 with PSRAM can be used.

### 1. Download and install ESP-IDF
This project was developed with ESP-IDF v5.0, so this version or later must be used. The next link contains the necessary instructions to download and install it, do the manual installation.

[Download and install ESP-IDF v5.0](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.0/esp32s3/get-started/index.html#installation)


### 2. Clone this repository:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mauriciobarroso/mtcnn_esp32s3.git
```

### 3. Configure the project:
Change the values in ``menuconfig->App Configuration->Camera Configuration`` to configure the camera pins and in ``menuconfig->App Configuration->Wi-Fi Configuration`` to set the Wi-Fi credentials.

```
cd mtcnn_esp32s3/
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py menuconfig
```

### 4. Flash and monitor
This project does not need a screen to display the image and the bounding boxes generated by MTCNN. Instead, it uses the console characters to print the output image and other relevant information. To monitor the console output run:

```
idf.py flash monitor
```

The console should print somethig like this:

```

### 5. Test
Once the device is connected to the previously configured network, point the camera towards any face. The console output should print something like this.
```
P-Net time : 65, bboxes : 3
R-Net time : 232, bboxes : 3
O-Net time : 789, bboxes : 3
MTCNN time : 1088, bboxes : 3
```

To observe the image captured by the camera and processed by MTCNN, you must access the following link http://ip_address/faces.jpg, where "ip_address" must be replaced by the IP address assigned to the device. It should show a result like this.
